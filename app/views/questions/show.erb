<!-- Need to add comment button
this is going to be similar to how to we did the Create Question!
Need button that says "Add Comment" which will then show the comment form (erb Comments/new) and then on submit of that form it will route to the POST on the comments Controller and create the comment
the data it sends back needs to match the data that is printed in a comment
we can use a partial here to display the comments (move everything in lines 10-12 into a partial)
it will be very similar to the question feature!  -->
